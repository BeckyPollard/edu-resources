## 

## **Week 1**

### 

### **Writing**

One of the first writings we know of: invoice of beer and barley written on cuneiform tablet, Mesopotamia.

Numbering system with cuneiform: Babylonian cuneiform numerals, a base-60 system.

[Babylonian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals):
* System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1\.  
* Numbers up to 59 are just some of the two types wedges.  
* Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.  
* Cuneiform.

The epic of Gilgamesh is an early work of literature from 2000BC.

### **Language**

Modern alphabets in Europe and Middle East descend from the Egyptian writing system that evolved around the same time and was influenced by the Sumerian system.  
Chinese and Indian writing systems might have evolved independently.  
Mesoamerican definitely did.

### **Printing**

Mesopotamia & pre-writing methods:

**Cylinder seals/stamps** rolled across clay tablets to print their motifs on them — often to verify a transaction or, later, a letter. Some of the seals were used more than **1,000 years before the development of writing**.

**Woodblock printing or block printing** is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from Tang dynasty China is the world's earliest printed text containing a date of production, **AD 868**.

### **Movable type**

* Enabled rearranging characters for different production of text.  
* The world's first movable type printing technology for paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around **1040 AD** in China during the Northern Song dynasty by the inventor [Bi Sheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng) (990–1051).  
* The [Gutenberg printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) made it possible to industrialize printing and commercialize, invented in Germany around **1440**.

### **Printing Terminology**

* **Typeface** – the literal face of the type piece, now used interchangeable with “font”  
* **Font** – a set of type pieces of particular size and weight  
* **Font weight** – bold, regular, light  
* **Serif** and **sans-serif** – fonts  
* **Typesetting** – now describes the process of preparing printable files (PDFs)  
* **Uppercase and Lowercase** – these terms come from the physical arrangement of type in the case drawers used by typesetters. Uppercase letters were stored in the upper drawer, and lowercase letters in the lower drawer  
* **Justification** – refers to aligning text to the left, right, center

## **Week 2**

Boolean data storage is really important to understand. On/off, long/short, yes/no... etc.

**Binary System:**

* Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).  
* Byte: Group of 8 bits.  
* Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2\.  
* 1 bit is of limited use – so we group bits into “bytes”.  
* Groups of 6, 8 and 9 bits were common in early days.  
* Now everyone uses bytes consisting of **8 bits**.  
* Sometimes the term “word” is used for a group of several bytes (**8 bytes \= 64 bits** is common in modern systems).

**Memory types:**

* **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off.  
  * RAM  
  * Very fast, short-term memory.  
* **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power.  
  * Storage or disk.  
  * Hard drive, SD card, flash drive, CD, punch card, paper...  
  * Large, cheaper than volatile, slower.  
  * ROM

**Units of Measurement**

* Kilo, Mega, Giga prefixes like usual  
* 1 Megabyte \= 8 MegaBits  
* Kilo for computers means 1024 though, since we base off 1024... but BOTH are sometimes used because people can’t agree. Make sure the definition in your context is clear.  
* Here’s the convention that nobody really remembers:  
  * MB, GB … for powers of 10  
  * MiB, GiB … for powers or 2 like 1024

### **Number Systems**

To avoid ambiguity between talking about binary digits (10 \= 2\) and numerical digits (10 is 10\)

* Whenever you use words like “ten” or “twelve” always use them to represent the number they mean in everyday language not the string of digits “10” and “25”.  
* When you want to say a binary number 10 (2) – spell out the digits “binary one zero” as if you are talking over a radio.  
  * “Binary one zero equals the number two”.

If you write a computer number, prefix it with type:

* `0b101` \= binary one zero one.  
* `0x1F1` \= hex one f one.

Saying “16-bit number” is a lot like saying “6-figure salary”, it’s how many digits there are \- a “bit” is a “binary digit”

### **Bits as Text**

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

Memory is a series of bytes.  
A file is a sequence of bytes.

## **Week 3**

What is a text? Indentations, paragraphs, spaces, etc. all help text be readable for humans.

Alphanumeric characters are letters and digits like A, b, c … and 0 to 9\.  
Non-alphanumeric characters (sometimes shortened as non-alpha) are everything else like {\[(+)\]};-)  
Many symbols have multiple meanings, such as dashes \- and angled brackets \<.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d78ea70-b995-4069-b497-40b2f5701360)

**Important text characters for programming**

* \_ underscore – (ex: file\_name)  
* ^ caret – (ex: 2^n)  
* \~ tilde – (ex: cd \~)  
* \\ backslash – (ex: \\n)  
* \` backtick, backquote  
* | pipe, vertical line

**Popular Markup Languages**

* HTML – HyperText ML  
* XML – eXtensible ML  
* YAML – Yet Another ML or YAML Ain't Markup Language  
* MarkDown  
* Wikitext / Wiki Markup – used to edit Wikipedia

**Proofreading Markup**  
Used in publishing for editing drafts. Proofreading marks (also called proofreaders' marks) are symbols and notations for correcting typeset pages

### **Markdown**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004\. You can preview it in the browser [here](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).

**HTML**

* Created by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1989\.  
* HTML is rendered by the browser  
* The browsers are some of the most complex projects on the planet  
* Browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and some other organizations  
* Thanks to strict standards all browsers can (mostly) display all web pages  
* Even the very first page can still be displayed: [see here](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

**Structured Data**  
JSON is newer and taking over, but XML is still used a lot. Both are text-based formats used to serialize structured data, they are intended to be read by computer software, but still be human-readable.

**JSON**

* **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation.  
* Format: {"key": "value"}.  
* Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.

**XML**

* e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage.  
* Similar to HTML, used for data representation.  
* Tags: \<tag\>value\</tag\>.

**Special Characters and “Escaping” Characters**  
Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences." The backslash method is used in most languages. Characters need to be escaped when they can be interpreted as another function in a program, for example denoting a string with quotation marks in them. Strings are denoted by being contained by quotations, so if a quotation mark is within the string the string might be interpreted as being ended within the data.

“This is a string that says “this is a string”” \= wrong  
“This is a string that says \\”this is a string\\”” \= correctly escaped

To display angled brackets **\< \>** in HTML, use: **\&lt;** and **\&gt;**. These are called character references.

## **Week 4**

Two main tools for the technology career: keyboards and text editors.

Keyboard mastery importance: efficient typing reduces cognitive load.

Keyboard types:
* Standard 104-key layout.  
* Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.

Keyboard layouts:
* QWERTY  
* AZERTY  
* Dvorak

Modifier Keys: modify the behavior of other keys \- Control, Shift, Alt etc. Great for keyboard shortcuts.

Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.

For text-editors, **IDE** stands for integrated development environment. They include and editor and many other tools. Like WebStorm. They’re optimized for programming. They’re often language-specific.

An **editor** is . Like Vim, Emacs, VScode.

**STRENGTHEN YOUR BACK MUSCLES IF YOU’RE GONNA BE SITTING AT THE COMPUTER ALL DAY. Consider the plank, hyperextension, or dead lift exercises.**

### **Keyboards**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53c5f4c3-8f74-4a51-9d0f-1b234c418eaf)

A **modifier key** temporarily modifies the normal action of another key

⇧ Shift  \- Shift  
⌃ Ctrl  \-  Control  
⎇ Alt  \-  Alternate – also labelled ⌥ Option on Apple keyboards.  
⌘ Cmd \- Command key, Apple keyboards  
⊞ Win  \-  Windows logo on Windows keyboards

A **function key** Fn (Function) is used on small-layout keyboards, or keyboard where the top row of function keys have multimedia functions like controlling audio volume.

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Learn ‘em, use ‘em, they’ll help so goddamn much.

[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings)

### **Touch Typing**

Touch Typing is typing without looking at the keyboard, using all fingers. Can be pretty fast. Efficient.

 “Reducing the cognitive demand of typing to almost nothing makes me feel a lot less tired at the end of a working day.”

[Gary Internet’s Guide To Typing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9hzmKMCWzbqIBqpA4j02a2XjuhJbILimBMAFM2Deis/view?tab=t.0)

## **Week 5**
