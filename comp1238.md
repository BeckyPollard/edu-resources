### Notes

#### Early Number Systems

**[Babylonian numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals)**:
* System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1.
* Numbers up to 59 are just some of the two types wedges.
* Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.
Cuneiform.

**[Egyptian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals)**:
Symbols for powers of 10.

**[Roman numerals](https://mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html)**:
* MCM = 1900 = 1000 + (1000 - 100).
* Subtractive notation - the numerals for 4 (IV) and 9 (IX) are written using subtractive notation, where the smaller symbol (I) is subtracted from the larger one (V, or X), thus avoiding the clumsier IIII and VIIII. Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).

#### Later Writing Systems

**Sumerian language:**
* Used syllabic writing.
* Sumerian was the language of ancient Sumer. It is one of the oldest attested languages, dating back to at least 2900 BC. It is a local language isolate that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia, in the area that is modern-day Iraq.
* Epic of Gilgamesh, a Sumerian poem collection.

**Early multi-language inscriptions:**
* Trilingual cuneiform inscription Xerxes I inscription at Van about how Xerxes is a god-appointed king.

![Xerxes I inscription at Van, written in Old Persian, Elamite and Babylonian](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd8269a5-a49e-4029-8338-9a3ff3dadea7)

#### Early Printing Methods

**Mesopotamia & pre-writing methods:**
* Cylinder seals/stamps rolled across clay tablets to print their motifs on them — often to verify a transaction or, later, a letter. Some of the seals were used more than 1,000 years before the development of writing.

**Woodblock printing or block printing** is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from Tang dynasty China is the world's earliest printed text containing a date of production, AD 868.

**Movable type:**
* Enabled rearranging characters for different production of text.
* The world's first movable type printing technology for paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around 1040 AD in China during the Northern Song dynasty by the inventor [Bi Sheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng) (990–1051).
* [The Gutenberg printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) made it possible to industrialize printing and commercialize, invented in Germany around 1440.

* Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
* Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.
* Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.

### Notes

#### Memory and Storage

**Binary System:**
* Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).
* Byte: Group of 8 bits.
* Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2\.
* 1 bit is of limited use – so we group bits into “bytes”.
* Groups of 6, 8 and 9 bits were common in early days.
* Now everyone uses bytes consisting of **8 bits**.
* Sometimes the term “word” is used for a group of several bytes (**8 bytes \= 64 bits** is common in modern systems).

**Memory types:**
* **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off.
  * RAM
  * Very fast, short-term memory.
* **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power.
  * Storage or disk.
  * Hard drive, SD card, flash drive, CD, punch card, paper...
  * Large, cheaper than volatile, slower.
 
![RAM vs Storage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c67d499a-53bb-4355-965c-fa1edbf030a6)

**Units of Measurement**
* Kilo, Mega, Giga prefixes like usual
* 1 Megabyte \= 8 MegaBits
* Kilo for computers means 1024 though, since we base off 1024... but BOTH are sometimes used because people can’t agree. Make sure the definition in your context is clear.
  * Here’s the convention that nobody really remembers:
    * MB, GB … for powers of 10
    * MiB, GiB … for powers or 2 like 1024

![Positional number systems](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e43a0f4f-5de5-4086-81c4-470f7618e6b4)

**How to talk about computer numbers without ambiguity**
* To avoid ambiguity between talking about binary digits (10 \= 2\) and numerical digits (10 is 10\)
* Whenever you use words like “ten” or “twelve” always use them to represent the number they mean in everyday language not the string of digits “10” and “25”.
* When you want to say a binary number 10 (2) – spell out the digits “binary one zero” as if you are talking over a radio.
  * “Binary one zero equals the number two”.

If you write a computer number, prefix it with type:
* `0b101` \= binary one zero one.
* `0x1F1` \= hex one f one.
* Saying “16-bit number” is a lot like saying “6-figure salary”, it’s how many digits there are \- a “bit” is a “binary digit”

![Two-Byte Integer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02367885-4df5-460d-a81b-d1af37a7df15)

**Number Representations**
* Unsigned Numbers: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.
* Signed Numbers: Range from \-128 to 127 for 8 bits.
* Fractional Numbers: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.

**Fractional Numbers: Floating Point Notation**
* 4.7988 \= 47988
* Write where the decimal is: 4.7988 \= 4
* Store both numbers: 4 & 47988

**Storage**
Some early computers could only address **64KB of memory** because the address was stores as a two-byte integer so they could only count to **65,535**.

**Files are a sequence of bytes.** Text files are files where each byte is interpreted as a character (or special symbol line new-line).

![If you open up any file as a text file, you can see the interpretation of text.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7f9c950-3f09-4d26-b601-230f9baac26a)

#### Bits to Text

**ASCII**
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

![American Standard Code for Information Interchange](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87e53e2c-0863-4712-bf15-0129106fcae3)

![Extended ASCII](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cbb87a6-9220-45dc-b81f-863eb555a76f)

**Codepages**
People started using the 128-255 range for a variety of characters from other languages:
* Latin1 – the most common (often default) code page
* Windows Code Pages CP-125x

Everything gets **messy** if you use a different code page, stick to Latin1. We have an updated system now called UNICODE.

![Windows Code Pages CP-1251](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f11cbd8-370b-47c1-b511-7fd545540951)


**Text Mode Computers**
Some early computers only outputted text, either via printer or with a screen with limited pixels. The Extended ASCII helped shape text interfaces for the screen.

![An example of a “text-mode” screen with bonus colour](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f27c4a0-64f3-42cc-83b6-605e01b397aa)

### Notes

#### Text Structure
Indentations, paragraphs, spaces, etc. help text be readable for humans.

Alphanumeric characters are letters and digits like A, b, c … and 0 to 9\.
Non-alphanumeric characters (sometimes shortened as non-alpha) are everything else like {\[(+)\]};-)
Many symbols have multiple meanings, such as dashes \- and angled brackets \<.

![Non-alphanumeric characters example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c76ff0d-a92a-4f77-8b92-ba941d28a1db)

#### Markup Languages

**Popular Markup Languages**
* HTML – HyperText ML
* XML – eXtensible ML
* YAML – Yet Another ML or YAML Ain't Markup Language
* MarkDown
* Wikitext / Wiki Markup – used to edit Wikipedia

**Proofreading Markup**
Used in publishing for editing drafts. Proofreading marks (also called proofreaders' marks) are symbols and notations for correcting typeset pages

![Proofreading Markup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e34120-8cbe-49c3-8895-f3bc08d95023)

**Markdown**
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004\. You can preview it in the browser [here](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).

![markdown writing vs render](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/886d0a2b-44b5-4401-abfe-afc60ed14c54)

**HTML**
* Created by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1989\.
* HTML is rendered by the browser
* The browsers are some of the most complex projects on the planet
* Browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and some other organizations
* Thanks to strict standards all browsers can (mostly) display all web pages
* Even the very first page can still be displayed: [see here](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

#### Structured Data

JSON is newer and taking over, but XML is still used a lot. Both are text-based formats used to serialize structured data, they are intended to be read by computer software, but still be human-readable.

**JSON**
* **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation.
* Format: {"key": "value"}.
* Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.

**XML**
* e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage.
* Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
* Tags: \<tag\>value\</tag\>.

## **Special Characters and “Escaping” Characters**

Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences." The backslash method is used in most languages. Characters need to be escaped when they can be interpreted as another function in a program, for example denoting a string with quotation marks in them. Strings are denoted by being contained by quotations, so if a quotation mark is within the string the string might be interpreted as being ended within the data.

“This is a string that says “this is a string”” \= wrong
“This is a string that says \\”this is a string\\”” \= correctly escaped

To display angled brackets **\< \>** in HTML, use: **\&lt;** and **\&gt;**. These are called character references.

![character references](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3af9be89-bd8c-4a87-955e-363e5ff4c0f9)

#### Unicode

Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard, is a text encoding standard maintained by the Unicode Consortium designed to support the use of text in all of the world's writing systems that can be digitized. Assigns a number to more characters, the numbers are called “Codepoints”.

ASCII codes → Unicode Codepoints.

![Unicode Emoji set](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cd9cab0-61a6-4b9b-a9ac-b980b48aaa7e)

Representing those codepoints in binary is not as straightforward, there are multiple ways to encode these characters:
* UTF-8
* UTF-16
* UTF-32

UTF-8 is a character encoding standard used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit. Almost every webpage is stored in UTF-8.

### Notes

#### Command Line Interfaces

**Origins of CLI**
* Originated from teletype machines connected to computers.
* Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens.
* Commands are often short due to historical reasons.

**Basic CLI Commands**
* ls \- List files in a directory.
* cd \- Change directory.
* pwd \- Print working directory.
* cat \- Display file contents.
* less \- View file contents interactively.
* cp \- Copy files.
