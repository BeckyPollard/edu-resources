# COMP1238 Lectures, weeks 1-14

## **Week 1 History: Numbers and Text**

### **Writing**

One of the first writings we know of: invoice of beer and barley written on cuneiform tablet, Mesopotamia.

Numbering system with cuneiform: Babylonian cuneiform numerals, a base-60 system.

[Babylonian numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_cuneiform_numerals):
* System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1.  
* Numbers up to 59 are just some of the two types wedges.  
* Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.  
* Cuneiform.

The epic of Gilgamesh is an early work of literature from 2000BC.

### **Language**

Modern alphabets in Europe and Middle East descend from the Egyptian writing system that evolved around the same time and was influenced by the Sumerian system.  
Chinese and Indian writing systems might have evolved independently.  
Mesoamerican definitely did.

### **Printing**

Mesopotamia & pre-writing methods:

**Cylinder seals/stamps** rolled across clay tablets to print their motifs on them — often to verify a transaction or, later, a letter. Some of the seals were used more than **1,000 years before the development of writing**.

**Woodblock printing or block printing** is a technique for printing text, images or patterns used widely throughout East Asia and originating in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from Tang dynasty China is the world's earliest printed text containing a date of production, **AD 868**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a0ccb1f-1d43-40a2-946f-dda5e6f85678)

### **Movable type**

* Enabled rearranging characters for different production of text.  
* The world's first movable type printing technology for paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around **1040 AD** in China during the Northern Song dynasty by the inventor [Bi Sheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_Sheng) (990–1051).  
* The [Gutenberg printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) made it possible to industrialize printing and commercialize, invented in Germany around **1440**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77e40652-4be1-4fb2-b53c-651a783ead67)

### **Printing Terminology**

* **Typeface** – the literal face of the type piece, now used interchangeable with “font”  
* **Font** – a set of type pieces of particular size and weight  
* **Font weight** – bold, regular, light  
* **Serif** and **sans-serif** – fonts  
* **Typesetting** – now describes the process of preparing printable files (PDFs)  
* **Uppercase and Lowercase** – these terms come from the physical arrangement of type in the case drawers used by typesetters. Uppercase letters were stored in the upper drawer, and lowercase letters in the lower drawer  
* **Justification** – refers to aligning text to the left, right, center

## **Week 2 Representing Text and Numbers in Computers**

Boolean data storage is really important to understand. On/off, long/short, yes/no... etc.

**Binary System:**

* Bit: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).  
* Byte: Group of 8 bits.  
* Binary Numbers: Numbers represented using base 2.  
* 1 bit is of limited use – so we group bits into “bytes”.  
* Groups of 6, 8 and 9 bits were common in early days.  
* Now everyone uses bytes consisting of **8 bits**.  
* Sometimes the term “word” is used for a group of several bytes (**8 bytes = 64 bits** is common in modern systems).

**Memory types:**

* **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off.  
  * RAM  
  * Very fast, short-term memory.  
* **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power.  
  * Storage or disk.  
  * Hard drive, SD card, flash drive, CD, punch card, paper...  
  * Large, cheaper than volatile, slower.  
  * ROM

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9563aa-9850-49bf-9be6-82a408f2e3e8)

**Units of Measurement**

* Kilo, Mega, Giga prefixes like usual  
* 1 Megabyte = 8 MegaBits  
* Kilo for computers means 1024 though, since we base off 1024... but BOTH are sometimes used because people can’t agree. Make sure the definition in your context is clear.  
* Here’s the convention that nobody really remembers:  
  * MB, GB … for powers of 10  
  * MiB, GiB … for powers or 2 like 1024

### **Number Systems**

To avoid ambiguity between talking about binary digits (10 = 2) and numerical digits (10 is 10)

* Whenever you use words like “ten” or “twelve” always use them to represent the number they mean in everyday language not the string of digits “10” and “25”.  
* When you want to say a binary number 10 (2) – spell out the digits “binary one zero” as if you are talking over a radio.  
  * “Binary one zero equals the number two”.

If you write a computer number, prefix it with type:

* `0b101` = binary one zero one.  
* `0x1F1` = hex one f one.

Saying “16-bit number” is a lot like saying “6-figure salary”, it’s how many digits there are - a “bit” is a “binary digit”

### **Bits as Text**

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet. In standard ASCII-encoded data, there are unique values for 128 alphabetic, numeric or special additional characters and control codes.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1e3c03-80c2-441e-810f-67e71c9d5c93)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf42abd1-eb6f-4e7d-9721-a8ef2aa67cfd)

Memory is a series of bytes.  
A file is a sequence of bytes.

## **Week 3 Structure of text**

What is a text? Indentations, paragraphs, spaces, etc. all help text be readable for humans.

Alphanumeric characters are letters and digits like A, b, c … and 0 to 9.  
Non-alphanumeric characters (sometimes shortened as non-alpha) are everything else like {\[(+)\]};-)  
Many symbols have multiple meanings, such as dashes \- and angled brackets \<.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d78ea70-b995-4069-b497-40b2f5701360)

**Important text characters for programming**

* \_ underscore – (ex: file\_name)  
* ^ caret – (ex: 2^n)  
* \~ tilde – (ex: cd \~)  
* \\ backslash – (ex: \\n)  
* \` backtick, backquote  
* \| pipe, vertical line

**Popular Markup Languages**

* HTML – HyperText ML  
* XML – eXtensible ML  
* YAML – Yet Another ML or YAML Ain't Markup Language  
* MarkDown  
* Wikitext / Wiki Markup – used to edit Wikipedia

**Proofreading Markup**  
Used in publishing for editing drafts. Proofreading marks (also called proofreaders' marks) are symbols and notations for correcting typeset pages

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/499bf9a4-3c21-40e6-a886-cae86e7c48d0)

### **Markdown**

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004. You can preview it in the browser [here](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ef9798-c388-4ba9-9d2f-59f255b50013)

**HTML**

* Created by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1989.  
* HTML is rendered by the browser  
* The browsers are some of the most complex projects on the planet  
* Browsers adhere to many standards maintained and developed by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and some other organizations  
* Thanks to strict standards all browsers can (mostly) display all web pages  
* Even the very first page can still be displayed: [see here](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

**Structured Data**  
JSON is newer and taking over, but XML is still used a lot. Both are text-based formats used to serialize structured data, they are intended to be read by computer software, but still be human-readable.

**JSON**

* **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation.  
* Format: {"key": "value"}.  
* Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.

**XML**

* e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage.  
* Similar to HTML, used for data representation.  
* Tags: \<tag\>value\</tag\>.

**Special Characters and “Escaping” Characters**  
Character combinations consisting of a backslash (\\) followed by a letter or by a combination of digits are called "escape sequences." The backslash method is used in most languages. Characters need to be escaped when they can be interpreted as another function in a program, for example denoting a string with quotation marks in them. Strings are denoted by being contained by quotations, so if a quotation mark is within the string the string might be interpreted as being ended within the data.

“This is a string that says “this is a string”” = wrong  
“This is a string that says \\”this is a string\\”” = correctly escaped

To display angled brackets **\< \>** in HTML, use: **\&lt;** and **\&gt;**. These are called character references.

## **Week 4 Keyboards, Text Editors, and Searching**

Two main tools for the technology career: keyboards and text editors.

Keyboard mastery importance: efficient typing reduces cognitive load.

Keyboard types:
* Standard 104-key layout.  
* Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.

Keyboard layouts:
* QWERTY  
* AZERTY  
* Dvorak

Modifier Keys: modify the behavior of other keys \- Control, Shift, Alt etc. Great for keyboard shortcuts.

Touch Typing: Encouraged for efficiency and reduced fatigue.

For text-editors, **IDE** stands for integrated development environment. They include and editor and many other tools. Like WebStorm. They’re optimized for programming. They’re often language-specific.

An **editor** is . Like Vim, Emacs, VScode.

**STRENGTHEN YOUR BACK MUSCLES IF YOU’RE GONNA BE SITTING AT THE COMPUTER ALL DAY. Consider the plank, hyperextension, or dead lift exercises.**

### **Keyboards**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53c5f4c3-8f74-4a51-9d0f-1b234c418eaf)

A **modifier key** temporarily modifies the normal action of another key

⇧ Shift  \- Shift  
⌃ Ctrl  \-  Control  
⎇ Alt  \-  Alternate – also labelled ⌥ Option on Apple keyboards.  
⌘ Cmd \- Command key, Apple keyboards  
⊞ Win  \-  Windows logo on Windows keyboards

A **function key** Fn (Function) is used on small-layout keyboards, or keyboard where the top row of function keys have multimedia functions like controlling audio volume.

### **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Learn ‘em, use ‘em, they’ll help so goddamn much.

[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings)

### **Touch Typing**

Touch Typing is typing without looking at the keyboard, using all fingers. Can be pretty fast. Efficient.

 “Reducing the cognitive demand of typing to almost nothing makes me feel a lot less tired at the end of a working day.”

[Gary Internet’s Guide To Typing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9hzmKMCWzbqIBqpA4j02a2XjuhJbILimBMAFM2Deis/view?tab=t.0)

### **IDE and Editors**

**IDE** stands for integrated development environment. They include and editor and many other tools. Like WebStorm. They’re optimized for programming. They’re often language-specific.

An **editor** is . Like Vim, Emacs, VScode.

Remember: Microsoft VSCode ≠ Visual Studio.

[Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)

### Search though text
CTRL + F

### RegEx
https://regexone.com/
https://regexr.com/

A whole language for creating search patterns
Cryptic and confusing, but you only need the basics

Examples:
* . matches any character
* [abc] – matches any of the listed characters
* [a-z] – matches any lower-case letter
* [0-9] – matches any digit, so does \d

Use tools like regexr.com for help building your regex.

## **Week 5 CLI**
### **Command Line Interfaces**
* Originated from teletype machines connected to computers.  
* Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens.  
* Commands are often short due to historical reasons.

Play [ZORK](https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/game/infocom/zork1/) to understand the command line. A somewhat interactive story. Heavily scripted, with very limited set of possible actions at each point. Similar to D&D games.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4de47030-19c5-4aea-994d-ccddb7396bbe)

### **Why Use CLI?**
* Some functionality has no GUI.  
* Precise control.  
* Faster \- for some types of work.  
* Easy automation of repetitive tasks.  
* Works great remotely over slow networks.  
* Requires very little computer resources compared to GUI.  
* Bonus: Makes it look like you know what you are doing.

### **Basic CLI Commands**
* ls \- List files in a directory.  
* cd \- Change directory.  
* pwd \- Print working directory.  
* cat \- Display file contents.  
* less \- View file contents interactively.  
* cp \- Copy files.  
* mv \- Move files.  
* mkdir \- Create a directory.  
* ping \- Test network connectivity.

## **Week 6 \- Git & HitHub**

**Git:**
* Open-source tool for version control.  
* Installed locally to manage files on your disk.  
* Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  
* Open-source software tool installed locally on your computer, developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005.  
* Your local git installation communicates with GitHub (or another git server).

**GitHub:**
* Cloud service for hosting Git repositories.  
* Commercial service in the cloud. Launched in 2008 as a startup.  
* Owned by Microsoft.  
* Provides a place to store your work in the cloud and share it with others.  
* Lots of extra functionality on top: GitHub Pages, GitHub Projects, web-based editing.  
* Alternatives to GitHub: GitLab, BitBucket...

### **Tools and Commands**
* Command Line Client: Uniform across different systems.  
* VS Code Integration: Recommended for beginners.  
* Git Commands:  
* git clone \<repo-url\>: Clone a repository.  
  * git pull: Update local repo with remote changes.  
  * git push: Upload local changes to remote repo.  
  * git commit \-m "message": Commit changes with a message.

### **Git Workflow**
![git](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afc834ac-ef51-4568-b44f-f43d1c1a1714)

### **Basic Git Workflow**
1. Clone: Copy a remote repository to your local machine.  
2. Pull: Retrieve the latest changes from the remote repository.  
3. Modify: Edit files locally.  
4. Commit: Save changes to your local repository.  
   * git commit \-m "commit message"  
5. Push: Upload changes to the remote repository.

### **Tips for Using Git**
* Commit Often: Helps track changes and revert if necessary.  
* Use Descriptive Messages: Makes it easier to understand history.  
* Communicate with Team: Avoids conflicts and ensures smooth collaboration.

## **Week 9 \- Structured Data & JSON**

There are no good definitions, afaik, for what structured data is. With time you will get a feel when one set of data looks more structured than the other.

Structured data is the boring type of data, like your spreadsheets.

Some data terminology:
* Forms  
* Records  
* Entry  
* Fields  
* Model / Schema

### **JSON**

JavaScript Object Notation. Made up of an object with key-value pairs. Keys are strings.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ebd136-2d40-4c32-b02c-225afbdb59ec)

Values can be of several types:
* Strings  
* Numbers  
* Boolean  
* Null  
* Array  
* Object

Key-value data in other contexts is also called:
* Associative array  
* Dictionary  
* Map  
* Hash Map / Hash Table

Limitations of JSON:
* Very strict \- must use quotation marks and commas  
* Writing JSON by hand is notoriously annoying with all the {“ ”},  
* No support for comments

JSON is very repetitive, wasteful in terms of bytes, very wet- but binary used to be the only option and that was so much more of a headache. JSON is so much more readable for humans.

[JASON\!\!\!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/press-x-to-jason)

### **YAML**
* YAML is like JSON with quotation marks and brackets omitted and replaced with indentation  
* YAML is almost a superset of JSON \- in most (but not all) cases code that accepts YAML will also accept JSON  
* YAML is way more convenient to write by hand  
* Often used for config files like the  \_confit.yml for GitHub Pages  
* Rarely used for storing or sending large amounts of data

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be342932-b5d4-4397-b965-f5e8785fc4cc)

### **A Note About XML**
XML was extremely popular in 2000s, JSON was simpler to deal with and native to JavaScript so it largely took over.

### **Serialization*
To “serialize” data is to convert it from some representation in RAM into a file format like JSON, YAML or XML. It becomes a series of bytes. The reverse process of going from JSON to RAM is called “parsing” or “de-serializing”.

### **Schema validation**
A JSON document can contain whatever information. Sometimes we want it to conform to some specific data model or schema. A schema validator is like the government official that looks at the form and tells us that the zip code is missing and the date should be in a different format. Schema is described in a separate file.

## **Week 10 \- Spreadsheets**
The concept of spreadsheets became widely known due to VisiCalc, developed for the Apple II in 1979. It also turned the personal computer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool.

Types of calculations in spreadsheets: Aggregate vs. scalar calculations

### **Why store data digitally?**
* Easy to share (now that we have internet).  
* Easy to modify.  
* Doesn’t get lost like paper does.  
* Does get lost in other ways \- keep backups\!  
* Convenient for sorting and filtering.

### **Spreadsheet Terminology**

**Scalar** \- Means for a single item. Example: 8\*1.50 is a scalar calculation.

**Aggregate (Rollups)** \- Grand total of all items in the set/order/column/whatever. Example: averages, totals.
* Sum  
* Average  
* Count  
* Min / Max  
* Median  
* Concatenate strings

## **AirTable**
[https://airtable.com/](https://airtable.com/)  
[YouTube Julian Post: Airtable vs Excel and Google Sheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHFvUmptIs0)  
[YouTube Julian Post: Airtable 2024 \- Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq3rQpodt58)

Airtable is known as a “Low-code tool”

Alternatives to Airtable:
* NocoDB  
* Baserow

Similar products:
* Notion’s databases

## **Week 11 \- DBMS**

**D**ata**B**ase **M**anagement **S**ystems

**Database** \- A collection of information that is organized for easy **storage, managements, updates, and retrieval**.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe20b28a-d514-41d7-aa31-8076cf2a55a5)

[https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology\#most-popular-technologies-database-prof](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#most-popular-technologies-database-prof)

### **SQL**

Sometimes pronounced as “sequel”. Used by many developers as their secondary language. Because most applications need to talk to databases.

## **Week 12 \- SQL**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84e518fa-9c29-4323-8256-84afa4c2001f)

**Primary key** \- unique identifier or id of a record in the table
* It can NOT repeated (must be unique)  
* Can NOT be NULL (empty)  
* Can consist of several columns

Foreign keys define the relations between tables.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78ed4780-bd73-4815-8d7e-b7eeede82de0)

**Table Indexes**  
We are constantly referring to rows by IDs \- lookup by ID must be fast. Scanning a million rows is not acceptable. “Index” is a special structure that allows for fast lookup without scanning the whole table. It works a lot like the letter index in paper address books.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3008e0bb-2dac-41f2-b8a8-d7ee2cbd5a97)

### **Relationships**

**Many-to-one relationship**  
As assignment can have exactly one course assigned but a course can have many assignments \- this is called many-to-one relationship.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e9b833c-31ff-4c91-abb7-e0ff857d09de)

## **Week 13 \- Working with Dates and Time**

The most intuitive units of time for us come from the movement of Earth around the sun and around its own axis. Revolution around the sun and the axis are independent. **One year happens to be a bit shorter than 365.25 days**. Rotation of the planet is not exactly smooth and stable \- there is a chaotic component, this generates some discrepancy between the astronomical time and time and atomic time. To synchronize them we occasionally insert the **leap seconds** in a year.

### **Key points about date and time**
* Humans give arbitrary names to time intervals.  
* Use UTC time when possible, convert to local time on client side.  
* Use ISO format or Unix time.  
* Avoid writing your own logic to convert between time zones, there is too much politics and history involved. The wheel has already been invented.

### **UTC = Coordinated Universal Time**

UTC took over the role of universal reference point from GMT. It’s based on atomic clock with leap seconds sometimes added manually.

### **Gregorian Calendar**

Named after Pope Gregory XIII (who looks like a [redcap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcap) from [D\&D](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Redcap)) who lived in the 16th century (1500s). A minor but painful modification of the Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar and introduced by him in 45 BC. Adoption of the Gregorian calendar took about 340 years.

**Timeline:**
* 1582 \- Spain, Portugal, France …  
* where pope was an authority  
* 1752 \- UK  
* 1700 \- 1752 \- Sweden  
* 1918 \- Russia (Jan 31 followed by Feb 14\)  
* 1923 \- Greece

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46622c7b-5880-419e-9c1f-1bb826aca6ba)

### **TZ Database**

The tz database is a collaborative compilation of information about the world's time zones and rules for observing daylight saving time, primarily intended for use with computer programs and operating systems.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz\_database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database)

### **ISO Time Format**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/060c9357-c321-4802-a519-353b7f88bc91)

### **Unix Time**

* The number of seconds that have approximately elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.  
* Convenient in code, because it's a single number.  
* Sometimes called “Epoch Time”.

## **Closing Course Notes**

**Master your tools**
* Keep practicing touch-typing.  
* Choose one editor you like and master it.  
* Get comfortable with CLI, ssh and git.  
* Automaticity reduces cognitive load, by a lot.  
* Mastery/Competence is one of the main components of motivation.

**The most important tool to master \- your body**
* Spending long time in front of a computer can become a problem but it doesn’t have to.  
* Learn how to minimize unnecessary muscle strain, learn to detect it.  
* Learn to know when it’s time to change something and when it’s time to stretch and take some rest.  
* **Get enough sleep.**

**Learning how to learn**
* Try to find out what works for YOU  
* It involves a lot of experimentation, with many failed experiments  
* There are many semi-formalized methods to try  
  * Spaced repetition  
  * The Cornell method of note taking  
  * Feynman Notebook Method  
  * SQ3R  
  * Mind Mapping
